# MSP430
Project that contains my entire code written in *Assembly MSP430*. Tested on *MSP430F169* microcontroller. Might contain mistakes. Based on knowledge found in:
* [Microprocessor Technology Blog by Kamil Możdżyński](https://monjino.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TM/overview?homepageId=1077051583)
* Documentary _PDF_ files available in `docs` directory:
    * `msp430f169.pdf`
    * `slau049f.pdf`
