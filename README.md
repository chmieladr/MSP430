# MSP430
Repository that contains my entire code written in *Assembly MSP430*. Tested on *MSP430F169* microcontroller. **Might contain mistakes!**

## Sources
* [Microprocessor Technology Blog by Kamil Możdżyński](https://monjino.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TM/overview?homepageId=1077051583)
* Documentary _PDF_ files available in `docs` directory:
    * `Blocks_scheme.pdf`
    * `msp430f169.pdf`
    * `slau049f.pdf`

> **Note!** If you just want to have a look at the code, it is recommended to use
  **_MSP430 Assembly_** extention in _Visual Studio Code_ that will (at least partially) highlight the code for you! 

## Main files
Here's a quick recap of what each project file contains. 
> It is highly recommended to have a look at all comments since they might significantly help you with understanding this entire messy code.

> The part below is still in work!
